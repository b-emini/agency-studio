                      1.Think’s Role: 1.1. The Services: Eminial Agency will
                      provide the services described in the Quote/Production
                      Estimate as presented. As an assignment develops, it may
                      be that the scope of the required work changes. Where this
                      is the case, Think will seek to discuss it with you at the
                      earliest opportunity in order to agree upon any variations
                      to the scope of the Services and the Quote/Production
                      Estimate, which may be necessary. Authors Corrections.
                      Unless specified in the Quote/Proposal, we include 2
                      rounds of changes on all items following the presentation
                      of an initial concept. Revisions briefed thereafter will
                      be charged according to Think’s standard hourly rate card.
                      1.2. Information: To maximise Eminial Agency’s
                      effectiveness we must work with you as a team. Often
                      Eminial Agency’s work will be dependent on you (or your
                      other advisers) providing information promptly. To avoid
                      unnecessary verification, Eminial Agency will assume all
                      information you provide is complete and accurate unless
                      you tell us otherwise. 1.3. Incidentals: Couriers or
                      printed proofs from external printers if required, to be
                      charged to client. 1.4. Termination: Should you wish to
                      terminate the contract after the commencement of work, you
                      will be invoiced for work already completed. 1.5. Force
                      Majeure: Eminial Agency shall not be liable for any delay
                      or failure to perform their obligations where such delay
                      or failure to perform arises from circumstances outside
                      Eminial Agency’s reasonable control.

                      2.1. Payment Terms: Invoices shall be settled by bank
                      transfer into Eminial Agency’s nominated bank account
                      within 14 days of the date on the invoice unless agreed
                      otherwise. Eminial retain ownership of all work until full
                      payment has been made. 2.2. Other Specialist Services:
                      Eminial Agency’s estimate is exclusive of third-party
                      costs such as photography, illustration, video production,
                      sound recording etc unless otherwise included in the
                      estimate. Eminial Agency may, unless you instruct us
                      otherwise, seek such specialist services on areas outside
                      our expertise. The costs of such services will be passed
                      on to and will be quoted according.

                        Where the client signs and approves this scoping
                        document, any changes beyond the scope will be handled
                        as a new update and priced accordingly.

                        4.1. Content and Images: It is your responsibility to
                        provide us with the required information about your
                        business and marketing objectives. Eminial Agency takes
                        no responsibility for errors in content supplied by you.
                        Any changes thus incurred may be chargeable at standard
                        rates. Unless specified otherwise, it is your
                        responsibility to provide all necessary text and graphic
                        materials that make up the content of the work. All
                        content must be supplied in a suitable digital format
                        unless agreed otherwise beforehand. Images should be
                        supplied as jpeg, gif, tif, png or psd format. Text
                        should be supplied as a Microsoft Word document. Failure
                        to supply material in an easily accessible format may
                        result in additional cost being incurred for retyping
                        text. Where the content which is provided is in a form
                        where a significant amount of copy writing is required,
                        a further charge may be made. 4.2. Information for
                        charts, graphs, and infographics to be supplied in
                        Excel. If we are required to retype large amounts of
                        content, then additional costs may be incurred. 4.3.
                        Client supplied images should always be high-res images
                        at 300DPI for print purposes. If they are solely for use
                        on the web, then lower resolution images are acceptable.
                        Eminial Agency will assume that all images supplied to
                        us are owned by the Client or have been purchased from
                        stock libraries and are licensed to the client for use.
                        We cannot use images taken from Google. 4.4. If you are
                        using images of children that you have taken, then we
                        will assume that you have been given the permission to
                        use these images. 4.5. You grant Think permission to
                        utilise logos and any other company identity for the
